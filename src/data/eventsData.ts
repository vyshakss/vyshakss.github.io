    "overview": "ANTRIX is a one-day technical design challenge that combines learning and competition, giving participants hands-on experience in antenna design, simulation, and testing using the ANSYS Electronics Suite (HFSS). Participants begin by learning the fundamentals of antenna theory and simulation through expert-led sessions and guided practice. They then apply their knowledge in a competitive antenna design challenge, where accuracy, innovation, and efficiency under time constraints determine the winners. The event aims to develop practical, industry-relevant simulation skills while encouraging problem-solving and technical creativity. Expected outcomes include hands-on ANSYS HFSS training, real-world exposure to antenna design and analysis, participation and winner certificates, mentorship from faculty experts, and an opportunity to showcase skills in a competitive environment.",

The event bridges theoretical strategy with real-time execution using an official Formula 1 Video Game. In Phase 1, teams are provided with a race setup dataset including track length, tire degradation profiles, pit lane loss time, fuel consumption rates, and weather forecasts to formulate an optimal stint and pit stop strategy. In Phase 2, these strategies are put to the test in a controlled in-game race scenario. Real-time telemetry (telemetry screen / UDP dashboard output displaying speed, tire wear, fuel levels, and lap deltas) is monitored by the teams as they make pit calls. The competition tests data analysis, decision-making under pressure, and dynamic adaptability.",

Teams calculate stint lengths, tire compound choices, and planned pit stop windows to submit their official Strategy Sheet.\n Round 2 In-Game Race Execution: Qualified teams run their planned strategy in an F1 game environment (set up with standardized car performance, AI difficulty, weather settings, and assists). To ensure fair judging and eliminate driver skill bias, the driving is handled by a standardized designated driver or fixed AI baseline, executing the precise pit calls commanded by each team’s \"Pit Wall.\" Teams monitor the in-game telemetry/dashboard to manage tire wear and lap deltas.\n Round 3 The Pit Wall Twist (Dynamic Adaptability) : Midway through the simulated race, dynamic variables occur (e.g., a Safety Car deployment, sudden rain, or virtual safety car). Teams get a short window to calculate and execute a modified pit stop strategy on the fly."

The event tests number system conversions, logic gate optimization, cryptographic problem-solving, and live hardware prototyping.\n\nStarting with a fast-paced cryptographic and riddle-based paper sprint, teams must decode a chain of interlinked puzzles — hexadecimal riddles, direction-finding clues, and a logic gate maze — before moving on to a three-stage classical cryptography round covering Caesar, Vigenère, and Playfair ciphers. Finalist teams then bring abstract logic to life by manually wiring physical Digital IC Trainer Kits under a ticking clock, before the grand finale challenges them to solve a sequence of deduction, decoding, and logic puzzles. The event has a low barrier to entry but a high skill ceiling, making it challenging for engineering students while remaining intuitive and playable.",

Solve.\nEach team is assigned an EV application and must develop one suitable Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) feature using an offline simulation environment. Depending on the assigned application, teams may implement features such as adaptive cruise control, collision avoidance, automatic emergency braking, obstacle detection, path following or speed control. Teams must demonstrate the working logic through simulation and explain how the feature satisfies the given vehicle requirements. The top 12 teams qualify for the next round.\n2.        Round 2 – EV DESIGN & PITCH: Design. Integrate. Defend.\nThe qualified teams must design the complete EV around their assigned application and the fixed technical constraints provided at the beginning of the event. The design must cover the vehicle architecture, chassis concept, drivetrain, motor and controller integration, battery placement, sensors, control system, ADAS integration, safety considerations and expected performance. Teams then pitch their complete EV concept to the judging panel and defend their engineering decisions through technical questions. The top 5-6 teams qualify for the final round.\n3.        Round 3 – EV BUILD: Build. Integrate. Demonstrate.\nThe top 5-6 teams receive access to the organizer-provided hardware platform specified by the original constraints. Teams must convert their proposed EV design into a working physical prototype by integrating the provided motor, controller, battery, sensors and other permitted components. The final vehicle is tested for basic mobility, control, ADAS response, stability, application-specific performance and overall compliance with the original problem statement."

But speed alone won't be enough—every turn, climb, jump, and obstacle will test the driver's concentration, control, and ability to master their machine. Penalties for collisions and missed sections will ensure that precision is just as important as pace.\n\nDesigned to bring the excitement of off-road motorsport to the college arena, MUD RUN promises an immersive and highly competitive experience for both\n\nparticipants and spectators.

    "overview": "Qizz–Whizz: Business Unplugged is a two-day, team-based business quiz designed to move beyond traditional question-and-answer formats. Instead of testing only memory, the event challenges participants to observe business clues, connect ideas, interpret commercial situations, identify brands and business models, make strategic decisions and take calculated risks. The quiz begins with broad preliminary rounds for all participating teams and progressively moves towards high-pressure championship rounds. Day 1 tests business awareness, observation, connections, commercial reasoning and strategic thinking. The top eight teams qualify for Day 2, where the format becomes more competitive through progressive clues, an interactive business board, an auction-style strategy round, a live boardroom battle and a final wagering challenge. The format is deliberately non-technical and suitable for both UG and PG participants. Questions may draw from brands, companies, entrepreneurship, marketing, strategy, consumer behaviour, business history, Indian business, markets and contemporary business developments without requiring specialist calculations or advanced technical knowledge.",

But I intend to make it care about me.\"\nRound 2: One Word (DAY 1)\nEach character distills their entire survival case into a single word to be drawn at random, then defends it in 1 minute flat.

The goal is to publicly weaken others' credibility while reinforcing your own relevance.\nExample: \"SpongeBob, your positivity doesn't fix a broken engine.\"\nRound 4: BACKSTAB (Crisis) (DAY 1)\nA dire crisis strikes the ship; evidence suggests the crash was planned. The captain hands participants a crisis to manage, implicating specific characters (e.g., engine schematics or weapons found in someone's possession), forcing accusations and defenses.

Participants begin by building a venture from randomly assigned opportunity and constraint cards, then develop its brand and market strategy. They subsequently assemble an executive team through a strategic talent auction, analyse business data using Excel, and prepare an investor pitch. In the final round, teams must adapt their venture to an unexpected business challenge and defend their decisions before a panel of judges acting as investors. The event tests creativity, entrepreneurial thinking, strategic decision-making, leadership, teamwork, analytical ability, and adaptability.",

The People puts their ability to build the right team to the test, while The Numbers challenges them to step into the shoes of decision-makers, interpret business information, and determine the direction of their venture. The journey continues into The Overnight Challenge, where shortlisted teams will take their venture to the next level through a challenge that extends beyond the day's competition. Finally, The Boardroom brings everything together as teams face the unexpected, defend their decisions, and put their venture to the ultimate test before a panel of investors."
